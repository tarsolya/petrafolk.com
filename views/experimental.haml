          %p Photo serial about an experimental project, called Design Coctail. Inspired by the idea, that any gastronomical photographs should create illusions of products which look too perfect and tempting, altough their origin may be not natural.
          %p In this serial, the coctails were made from different materials like mud and cotton wool, which are not edible or drinkable.
